This is a page in development, only some toy codes are available for references. 
To obtain the integral model prediction for the halo SIDM-796, run
python getVRmaxplotISO.py

A Mathematica notebook (basicHalos.nb) is designed for the basic approach. It can be used to obtain the density and velocity dispersion profiles in SIDM for a single halo.
